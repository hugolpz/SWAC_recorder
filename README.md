# SWAC_recorder
Shtooka / SWAC recorder was a serial audio recording system for words or phrases, in C++ and for desktop, developped by Nicolas Vion around 2010.
SWAC recorder's 140,000 audios had great impact on the field of language learning and on the then emerging field of native mobile Apps, with dozens of hundreds apps reusing its clean and open source audios.
SWAC recorder's main limitation was its difficul installation process, requiring professional skills.

As of 2018, SWAC recorder have now been supersed by [LinguaLibre.fr](https://lingualibre.fr/wiki/Special:RecordWizard), an open source Web App using GTML5 audio recording API.
LinguaLibre was support by Wikimedia France (Paris) and the Wikipedia Foundation (San Francisco).
